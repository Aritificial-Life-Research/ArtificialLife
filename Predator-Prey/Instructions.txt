Instructions to run the program.

There is a single python code file "Predator-Prey.py". 

Make sure python is installed in your system. I have used python version 2.7.

1. Unzip the assignment folder.
2. Navigate into the assignment folder using command prompt. 
3. Type in command prompt "pip install numpy"
4. Type in command prompt "pip install matplotlib"
3. Type in command prompt "python Predator-Prey.py"
4. The program would run and show two plots showing stable osscilation. One without extended terms and one with extended terms.
5. The program would print mean observations and final observations for both the systems in the console.
9. There are also screenshots of program run in console and of plotted graphs.

if you need any help feel free to contact via email.
