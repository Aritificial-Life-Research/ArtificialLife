Programming assignments done in Masters In Computer Science course "Artificial Life", using Java or C++.

## 1D-Cellular Automata

Implement a 1-dimensional cellular automaton with the k = 2 states {0, 1}, with a neighborhood
radius of r = 1 or r = 2, and 84 cells.

The boundary cells j = 0, j = 1, j = 82, j = 83 shall be fixed to the content aj = 0. The
programm shall depict in every line the complete state of all 84 cells as text console ASCII
output.

Implement two possible starting conditions for the CA:
S: a seed (all cells are empty but cell no 42, ai=42 = 1), and
R: random starting condition, each cell is set with a probability of p = 0.5.
Let the user enter at runtime: the neighborhood radius r, the rule for the CA (Wolfram
Notation), and the starting condition (S or R).

Please use C, C++, or Java to implement your program.
Send an E-Mail to your tutor containing the documented source code, a description how
to compile and run your program (e.g. give the commands), and a file containing at
least 10 lines of result.
